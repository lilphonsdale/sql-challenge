#Description

The provided data was observed in csv format and an Entity Relationship Diagram was developed thanks to QuickDBD.

The schema.sql file was loaded in PGAdmin and the data was uploaded in order so that all of the foreign key relationships were respected. The order applied for data uploads was the same as the order the tables were created in the schema.

With the data in place, a series of queries and subqueries were created. These queries use SLECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY. These are found in the challenge.sql file.
